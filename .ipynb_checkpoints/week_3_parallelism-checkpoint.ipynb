If the computeMinibatchGradients function was being run on different processors in a distributed system, what data would you have to send to the processors for each minibatch? What information would these distributed processors need to send back?\n",

As we discussed in class on Tuesday, model parallelism involves splitting up a network between processors such that different portions of the same layer might be computed on different processors. Knowing that the example network is comprised of two full-connected layers, what changes would you have to make to the code to be able to employ model parallelism. (Note, actually doing this would be an enormous amount of work, but think critically about which parts of the network would need to be rewritten to achieve model parallelism.) \n",
